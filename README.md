We prepared the HR dataset for attrition prediction by first splitting it into train and test sets with stratification to preserve class proportions. Numeric features were scaled and categorical features one-hot encoded without leaking information from the test set. The minority class was partially augmented using SMOTE to increase its samples from 130 to around 275, while leaving the test set untouched. We then added engineered features, such as income per year at company, stock options per total working years, and binned distance from home, with one-hot encoding applied to new categorical features. A Random Forest classifier was trained on the processed and augmented training data, and its performance was evaluated on the test set using a classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC. Finally, we visualized the top 20 feature importances to identify which variables contributed most to the model’s predictions.
